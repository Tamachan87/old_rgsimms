#My Work Computer: A Review

When you work for any organization that gives you a standardised computer for all your work needs, it infuses a sense of belonging to said organisation. It makes you feel like you belong and makes you trust your boss more since he or she has been so generous to you. Let's review my little special piece of hardware, I lovingly nicknamed "Chunk".

##Specs

This beast boasts a monster Pentium 4 processor, 512MB of RAM, and an on-board graphics card that will make your mother weep in fear. The processor's heatsink is so powerful and awesome that it whirrs like a helicopter that smokes 20 cigarrettes a day. The heat generated is enough to fry an egg, your balls, and any loved ones within a mile radius. No-one can comprehend the awesomeness of this thing.

##Performance

After a few false starts (re: crashes) Windows XP booted up. I'm very lucky in that I'm in Service Pack 1. I'm not bogged down with any more bloatware updates. The always incredible Internet Explorer 6 only take a minute and thirty seconds to load, and renders pages in just the way I like them - like a really cool PowerPoint. Most pages can be scrolled sideways too. Take that and stick it up your "widescreen" and "high definition" and "functional" equipment. After I emailed my wife the computer saved me the trouble of shutting down by crashing itself. Maybe it has an AI built into it as well?!? So cool!

##Special Features

The mouse is designed to force you to be productive. When you have a fast, responsive, laser mouse, your cursor tends to dance all over the place to Twitter, to Facebook, maybe even to BBC News. With this state-of-the-art ball operated mouse, moving the cursor is so difficult that you really have to think about "do I *need* to click on this now?".

Perhaps my favourite feature of all is that every few minutes Windows will lock up, forcing you to take those 15 minute breaks the health-doctor-type people are always banging on about.


All-in-all, I'd give my work computer a pretty damn decent 8/10. I deducted two points for it actually being in black, not the standard smoke-room beige everyone else in the office has.
