[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org "ImageMagick") is an extremely handy commandline based image manipulation program. This program is very useful, especially when dealing with a lot of images that you need resizing or editting. It even has a feature that you can merge images, or align them side by side in a grid or horizontal/vertical line.

That is, if you can get it to work.

ImageMagick has got to be *the* most temperamental pieces of software I've ever come across. Unless you have all the dependencies pre-installed, it's in a good mood, and the planets have aligned corrected, ImageMagick has a tendancy to throwing a massive hissy-fit. Maybe it won't install properly, maybe it will only install up to half-way before giving up, maybe it will just *crash your entire bloody app if you want to use it*.

My advice for people who don't want to spend ages Googling error codes and fiddling with every single piece of nitty gritty rubbish just to resize an image, is to install [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org "Gimp") and do everything manually. If you can get it to work, then you have struck the most sacred of holy gold's the world has ever known. I feel that in the end, you'd spend just as much time trying to make it work as you would just doing the repetitive malarky.
