# Kantan-Blog: My first RubyGem

## Idea

I've been looking through GitHub and RubyGems recently (is it my imagination or is everything CamelCase these days?) for a simple blogging tool for this site. Like Goldilocks, some are too big, requiring an entire site built from scratch for it, some are too small, trying to achieve speed with their own separate engines and other bells and whistles, but none are just right.

Maybe the Goldilocks metaphor would work better if I was a girl...or had blonde hair...or broke into houses...or had anything to do with bears. I like porridge, though.

Anyway, I've decided to make my own RubyGem. It will be a small CLI-based app that generates a markdown file in a generated folder. The main blog page will contain the titles of the blogs as links. In a way, it will act very much like the postmarkdown gem I'm using now, although I have had to wrestle it like a big hairy bear (hey, there we go!) in order to get it to play nicely with the rest of the site.

## Execution

I've already made a repository [here](https://github.com/Tamachan87/kantan-blog "kantan-blog"). I called it "Kantan-Blog". As Ruby is often affiliated with it's creator's Japaneseness, I've opted to call it 簡単ブログ which is Japanese for "Simple Blog". I have no real time limit or an expected time of deployment. I am outright enforcing [Valve Time](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time "valve time") on this.

## 終わり

I'm never quite sure on how to end a blog, so here's a picture of my sarcasm detector.
