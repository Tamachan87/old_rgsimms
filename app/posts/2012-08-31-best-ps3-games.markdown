Being on a [limited internet plan]() sucks quite a lot when you realise that those lovely games you bought off the Steam Sales are going to eat right through your monthly allowance, and those hundreds of hours you used to spend on TF2 are slowly waving as they assend into the heavens. So, I've decided to list my favourite PlayStation 3 games for one and all to see.

5. # Eternal Sonata

I'll come right out now and say I'm a sucker for JRPGs. Sure, a lot of them have an almost standardised set of characters that you put up with for 40 hours whilst the "friendship triumphs over evil" story unfolds after you've grinded a couple of hundred levels, but every now and then you get one that almost effortlessly rises above the rest. Eternal Sonata isn't an exclusive PS3 title but I think it deserves a mentioning. Set inside the mind of dying composer Frédéric Chopin, you and your merry band of funky dressed companions go on a quest to see Count Waltz about some mineral powder but *all is not what it seeeeeeeems* (cue dramatic music). The battle system is very nice half-real-time and half-turn-based, with light and dark playing a rather big role. It looks beautiful, plays wonderful, sounds lovely, and the choice of location is incredibly original.
