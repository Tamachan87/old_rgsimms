#My review of Codecademy

##Backstory.js
I have always dabbled more in design before my love of development took over. I love making cool things more than making things look cool. I found Codecademy through a [LifeHacker](http://us.lifehacker.com/5836220/codecademy-is-a-free-interactive-webapp-that-teaches-you-how-to-code "LifeHacker") article. It seemed all lovely jubbly so I signed up expecting to be flinging awesome dropdown animated menus and maybe even a little game or two as a last big test of my JavaScript Ninjaness.

##Reality Bites
The problem I think I first had was that I went in with the wrong mindset. I had already known about JavaScript and what it can do, so I was expecting to learn *JavaScript*. Instead, it teaches you about variables and methods and loops (oh my!) and it was then that I realised that Codecademy wasn't teaching JavaScript, but it was teaching *coding*. That's probably an important note to make before evangelising the awesomeness of this site.

The lessons are taught with the instructions and explanations on the left and a charmingly little editor with a console underneath. The editor is rather nice to use and has nice syntax highlighting and even has handy little yellow alert when you forget (and you will bloody forget) semi-colons. All in all, it is very nicely presented and it keeps the lessons short enough to keep beginners going.

##Mind over matter...mind under matter? Doesn't matter. Nevermind.
With the little JS/coding stepping stone stepped over I dove in and went through the lessons. The little bar on the left hand side gives you a (very) short explanation of the concept it's teaching, and a small task at the bottom. These vary from "write an entire function" to "just run the code". I'm not joking about the latter. In fact, it happens pretty often.

This is probably the biggest problem I have with Codecademy. Whilst it's ideal of making the massively intimidating task of learning to code more accessible and immediately interactive, as someone who has spent a few years as a teacher, just saying "read this until it makes sense" is a horrible way of learning. In fact, for the most part you don't write much code of your own - you simply modify a word or a line of a block of prewritten code and click run. The use of badges (or achievements or trophies, whatever the kids are measuring their e-penis' with these days) can be a nice little incentive for some to keep going, but for the more hoarding-challenged amongst us this just results in clicking run and never really learning what happened, why, and what for.

There was also the case that some lessons call for the [learner to use skills that haven't been taught yet](http://www.codecademy.com/forums/4fc28619c61eb0000302a97d/forum_questions/4fc43126cebe09000300f1d9 "skillz"). This doesn't happen a lot, but in all honesty it shouldn't happen at all. What is obvious to a m@sT0r haxxor is not obvious (at all) to a learner.

##Alone: adj. In bad company
I admit that that little niggling laziness was my major gripe with Codecademy. Their labs section is showing some promise with the inclusion of Ruby and Python. It will be interesting to see how well it stands up to the _why standard [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org "TryRuby"). Overall, I would recommend Codecademy to someone who has absolutely no background in coding and is *very* diligent about learning. People who already know what a variable is, how to iterate through an array, etc. will find the pace and the style to be very challenging to their patience.

I would recommend using Codecademy as a "dip in, dip out" way of learning. If you fancy going through a few lessons at night, when you've got 5 minutes to kill before your butler brings your caviar. Just jump in, earn a badge, jump out.

I would *not* advise using Codecademy as your main method of learning. Get yourself a good book, join StackExchange, and just get coding on something you find fun!
