			<h1>Why Ruby?</h1>
			<p>If I'm being honest, I had a hard time choosing a main language to learn. I have dabbled in different languages before, such as C++ and Java, but they never really clicked with me. I felt I was spending too much time worrying about X when I should be actually coding. To cut a long story short, ruby is actually my birthstone so I decided to try Ruby out. I found it's syntax easy to remember and it is phenomenally easy to read.</p>
