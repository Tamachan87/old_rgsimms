			<h1>Richard's Profile</h1>
			<h2>Who are you?</h2>
			<p>I'm a little nerd from the North of England. I moved to Japan for 2 years where I taught English somewhere in-between reading manga and coding.</p>
			<h2>Seriously, how did you get in here?</h2>
			<p>Details are for later, friend. On an unrelated note, you should lock your doors more securely.</p>
			<h2>What can you do?</h2>
			<p>Besides being prone to short bursts of laughter over little things like cats, I also enjoy making things using Ruby. I chose to learn Ruby because it was my birthstone. I also love using Python, which I find to be much more robust, but Ruby is much easier to code in. I love problem solving, even with things that seemingly make no sense. Not being bound to "logic" can be a plus.</p>
